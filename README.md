# Heart-Disease-Detection
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels.[2] CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). Heart disease prevention is a major health concern. It's vital that people learn to identify and manage heart disease risk factors, such as heart-healthy eating, regular exercise, and seeing a doctor to measure blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight. This application tells us if a cell contains a malignant or benign cancer. The dataset is from Kaggle website, which was updated and more used for the detection and analysis. Got a good knowledge about various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, GaussianNB, K-Neighbours Classifier.
